# Acoustic-Adversary-Project
Demonstrated the vulnerability of Google's YAMNet audio classifier to adversarial attacks. Implemented FGSM and PGD attacks with increasing perturbation strengths (Ɛ) on LibriSpeech audio. Results show PGD is highly effective at causing misclassifications, highlighting critical security risks in audio AI.
